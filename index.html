<br>

<br><br>
<div   align="justify"> I received the B.S. degree in Computer Science from Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo in 2012, and the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from University of São Paulo in 2015. <br><br>

Now, I'm pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the University of São Paulo. I've been working full-time as an academic researcher for some years, including some experiences as teaching assistant to undergrad subjects, journal reviewer, and undergrad research project co-advisor.

<br><br> My research interests include Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Supervised Learning, Multiagent Systems and Computer Vision. I welcome new collaboration opportunities, just e-mail me.</div>

<font size=4><i>Transfer Learning in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Systems</i></font>

<br><br>
<div   align="justify">Reinforcement Learning is a powerful and autonomous tool to train intelligent agents. 
This learning is initially performed by sucessive interactions between agents and the environment in a trial and error manner, until the agent has enough information to perform its tasks. 
However, when multiple agents are present in the same environment some sort of coordination is required, since the environment becomes non-stationary. Centralized approachs are usually infeasible, since the state space can be huge even for simple problems. 
Thus, distributed approaches are required for many Multiagent domains. 
This research aims to develop a framework to accelerate learning in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Systems by applying Transfer Learning, which has been successfully applied in Single Agent domains but has no robust algorithm to complex Multiagent domains.</div><br>


<br>
<font size=4><i>Automated Bee Species Identification through Wing Images </i><br><br></font>
<div   align="justify">Bees have a huge importance to pollination, which motivated research focused on their conservation. 
However, some bee species are so similar that only a few specialized taxonomists are able to make a proper discrimination. 
This project studied computer vision and machine learning methods applied to bee wing images to discriminate bee species.
I'm not working on this project as a first author anymore, but I've been advising undergraduate research projects on this topic.</div><br><br>

<font size=5><b>Other Passions</b></font><br /><br>
<p align="justify">• <b>Music</b> - I've been playing electric guitar since I was 15 years old. Even though I'm far to claim to be in level to professional musicians, you can count on me if you want to have fun playing some old good heavy metal.  <br /><br>
• <b>Horror Movies</b> - I was just a little boy when I first watched "Night of the living dead". Thereafter I cannot spend a week without watching a B movie (specially the brain-eater zombie ones).<br /></p>
